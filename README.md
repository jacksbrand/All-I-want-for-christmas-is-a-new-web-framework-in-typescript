# All I want for Christmas is a new web framework in TypeScript

A simple front end framework for handing typical models. Models contain 'events', 'attriutes' and 'sync' properties. This is essentially an implementation of a small section the Backbone / Marionette in TypeScript

The 'User' model and view has been implemented, but the code should be designed to be as reusable as is reasonable.
